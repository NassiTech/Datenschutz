# Data Protection Glossary

## 1. Personal Data
**Definition:** Information related to an identified or identifiable person.
**Example:** Name, address, email address, IP address.

## 2. Sensitive Data
**Definition:** Particularly sensitive personal data, such as health status, ethnic origin, or political opinions.
**Example:** Medical records, biometric data.

## 3. Anonymization vs. Pseudonymization
- **Anonymization:** Process by which personal data is modified so that identification is no longer possible.
  **Example:** Removing all direct and indirect identifiers from a database.
- **Pseudonymization:** Replacing personal data with a pseudonym so that identification is only possible with additional information.
  **Example:** Replacing customer names with a customer number.
- **Relationship:** Both serve to protect personal data, but anonymization is irreversible while pseudonymization allows re-identification with additional data.

## 4. Data Protection vs. Data Security
- **Data Protection:** Protection of personal data against misuse and unauthorized access.
  **Example:** GDPR regulations for processing personal data.
- **Data Security:** Technical and organizational measures to protect data from loss, manipulation, or unauthorized access.
  **Example:** Encryption, firewalls, access controls.
- **Relationship:** Data protection sets the rules, while data security ensures compliance through technical safeguards.

## 5. Consent and Data Processing Agreement
- **Consent:** Voluntary agreement of a person to the processing of their personal data.
  **Example:** Accepting cookies on a website.
- **Data Processing Agreement:** Processing of personal data by a service provider on behalf of a company.
  **Example:** Cloud services storing and managing customer data.
- **Relationship:** Consent is required for data collection, while a data processing agreement ensures compliance when data is handled by third parties.

## 6. Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default
- **Privacy by Design:** Data protection measures are considered from the outset in the development of IT systems and processes.
  **Example:** Default-enabled privacy settings in an app.
- **Privacy by Default:** Privacy-friendly settings are activated by default.
  **Example:** A social media platform initially displaying only public information.
- **Relationship:** Privacy by Design ensures systems are built with privacy in mind, while Privacy by Default ensures that the most protective settings are the standard.
